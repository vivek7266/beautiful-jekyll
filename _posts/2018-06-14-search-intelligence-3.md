Extended from the previous post, we will explore Solr UI here. This post is third in its series of exploration and understanding of Solr for the purpose of full text search technology (1st post, 2nd post). Solr provides with UI that has powerful analysis tools along with admin capabilities. In this story we will explore admin tools such as core addition, core reload and core deletion along with core level configurations.

Letâ€™s navigate to solr home directory (remember we set SOLR_HOME in the last post). You can pull an initial configuration setup that I have posted on github (https://github.com/vivek7266/solr-config).
